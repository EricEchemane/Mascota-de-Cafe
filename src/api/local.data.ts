			"My friend and I are coffee lovers and we've been drinking coffee together to alleviate our stress from work and one time we had a small misunderstanding about things and I admit, it’s my fault because I said something that would trouble her. So I decide to buy her a cup of coffee as a piece of offering. So I look for a Café nearby and I found Mascota Café. This cafe caught me because they have pets inside the cafe and they have an affordable and wide range of coffee and pastry. So after I make up with my friend, Mascota Café has our hangout place.",

			'I’m a dog lover so when I hear about Cafés nearby our house that was opening. I open up my schedule for their opening. Since I’m living in an apartment and our apartment rules that no pets should allow so I have been missing to have a dog. So this Café bright up my life, funny right but I love dogs. Mascota De Café has been my hang-out place after work or when I don’t have work. There a dog that I been playing with and I want to adopt it but how? The landlord will surely get mad at me. I look for another rental place around that allowed dog and I found one. Thank god the dog that I was playing with wasn’t adopted yet. Thanks to the staff that serves the dog for me.',

			'I’m a college student taking business management. Studying college was sure pain in the pocket. So while my friend and I are having coffee while doing our research I notice that the café is looking for a part-timer. I love the coffee and pastry here and for entertainment are the pets. So I said to myself why not apply here part-time so that I can have a side income and help my parents in financials. Gladly they accept me. I was even happier serving others and have the pets adopted by the rightful owner.',

It tastes like Korean macaroons and I love it partner with Ice Americano Coffee. Perfect for a break time snack in the office. I thank the owners who think of building a café like this. Also, I already have adopted two kittens from them using the loyalty card.',
