			"My friend and I are coffee lovers and we've been drinking coffee together to alleviate our stress from work and one time we had a small misunderstanding about things and I admit, it’s my fault because I said something that would trouble her. So I decide to buy her a cup of coffee as a piece of offering. So I look for a Café nearby and I found Mascota Café. This cafe caught me because they have pets inside the cafe and they have an affordable and wide range of coffee and pastry. So after I make up with my friend, Mascota Café has our hangout place.",

			"I’m a dog lover so when I hear about Cafés nearby our house that was opening. I open up my schedule for their opening. Since I’m living in an apartment and our apartment rules that no pets should allow so I have been missing to have a dog. So this Café bright up my life, funny right but I love dogs. Mascota De Café has been my hang-out place after work or when I don’t have work. There a dog that I been playing with and I want to adopt it but how? The landlord will surely get mad at me. I look for another rental place around that allowed dog and I found one. Thank god the dog that I was playing with wasn’t adopted yet. Thanks to the staff that serves the dog for me.",

			"I’m a college student taking business management. Studying college was sure pain in the pocket. So while my friend and I are having coffee while doing our research I notice that the café is looking for a part-timer. I love the coffee and pastry here and for entertainment are the pets. So I said to myself why not apply here part-time so that I can have a side income and help my parents in financials. Gladly they accept me. I was even happier serving others and have the pets adopted by the rightful owner.",

			"I love this type of café because they have pets that customers can play with and of course my favorite pastry here was their macaroons. It tastes like Korean macaroons and I love it partner with Ice Americano Coffee. Perfect for a break time snack in the office. I thank the owners who think of building a café like this. Also, I already have adopted two kittens from them using the loyalty card.",
